            <p>Every step we take as an organization (new projects, collaborations with the public sector, journalistic investigations, delivery of training, etc.) forms part of a deliberate effort to effect cultural and social change. In order to focus on priorities, at the end of 2015 we synthesised <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://propuestas.civio.es/">11 concrete proposals for transparency and accountability</a> into a manifesto, with the aim of engaging the main political parties in executing these proposals. Acting as a pressure group, we met openly and publicly with representatives of 6 parties, to convey our reasons and explain their practical and viable application. All of our proposals featured <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://propuestas.civio.es/partidos.html">in their electoral programs</a>, although not to the same extent, and have formed the basis of our advocacy throughout 2016.</p>

            <p>Transparency of public agendas became a priority in 2016. We produced a document of recommendations for the publication of these <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://civio.app.box.com/s/z578ox9psa5hxxzte1ignadoso2zc1qn">work schedules and meetings of senior officials</a> and we shared this with the Transparency Council, which began to work on this area after finding that there were dozens of requests for information regarding said schedules, many of them submitted by Civio. Thus, some of our suggested measures were adopted by this regulator for its 2017 recommendations on the subject. In 2016 we also signed a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.civio.es/2016/02/el-consejo-de-transparencia-y-la-civio-colaboraran-para-difundir-el-derecho-a-acceder-a-la-informacion-publica/">collaboration agreement</a> with the Council to jointly disseminate the right to access public information.</p>
            <p>2016 was an unusual parliamentary year, with an interim government in place for various months. On a national level, we pushed Congress to adopt measures to visually publish the Chamber's detailed budgetary information, and these <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SalaPrensa/NotPre?_piref73_7706063_73_1337373_1337373.next_page=/wc/detalleNotaSalaPrensa&amp;idNotaSalaPrensa=19291&amp;anyo=2016&amp;mes=4&amp;pagina=1&amp;mostrarvolver=S&amp;movil=null">were approved</a> by the Board of Congress. Furthermore, in March, we and other organizations met with the socialist candidate for the Presidency, and his team, to lay out priorities in the field of transparency. At this meeting, we called for more <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/civio/statuses/715552838731108353">concrete action</a> and more details on how he planned to implement this.</p>
            <p>Together with the meetings schedule, <strong>transparency of public procurement</strong> was our other main line of advocacy in 2016. We met with the main parliamentary groups to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.civio.es/2016/12/civio-insta-a-los-partidos-a-enmendar-la-ley-de-contratos-publicos-con-un-regulador-independiente-y-mas-transparencia/">request an amendment</a> to certain aspects of this law, currently pending, <strong>and we will continue to lobby for this</strong>. We also worked at local and regional government levels. Some examples:</p>

            <p>In the <strong>Community of Madrid</strong>, two groups â€“<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2016/05/24/madrid/1464105117_840718.html?id_externo_rsoc=TW_CC">Ciudadanos</a> and Podemos- based several of their amendments to the regional project on the Law on Transparency on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.es/dolores-gonzalez-pastor/un-verdadero-compromiso-p_b_10205646.html">our proposals</a>. The process is still pending to this day. We thoroughly analyzed and published recommendations both to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.civio.es/2016/04/el-proyecto-de-ley-de-transparencia-de-la-comunidad-de-madrid-situa-al-ejecutivo-como-juez-y-parte-en-su-vigilancia-y-regimen-sancionador/">draft</a> submitted by the regional government and to that, drafted and submitted <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.civio.es/dev/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Informe-Proyecto-PSOE-Ley-de-Transparencia-de-la-Comunidad-de-Madrid.pdf">by the Socialist Party</a>. We maintain three priorities: independent monitoring, a penalty system, and greater requirement for active advertising.</p>

            <p>The <strong>City Hall of Madrid</strong> invited us to participate in the development of the municipal transparency regulation. During one <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.civio.es/registro-reuniones/">meeting</a> with the Directorate General of Transparency, we shared <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.civio.es/2016/01/valoracion-de-civio-sobre-el-borrador-de-la-ordenanza-de-transparencia-del-ayuntamiento-de-madrid/">our assessment</a> of the draft .Some of the points covered were ultimately incorporated in the regulation. During the entire process, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.civio.es/2016/07/en-defensa-de-un-registro-de-lobbies-eficaz-en-la-ordenanza-de-transparencia-del-ayuntamiento-de-madrid/">we advocated</a> for one of the most important parts, the Register of Lobbies, to be set out in a more efficient way. The results are now materialising in 2017.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the City Council of Madrid asked us for a letter of support for its candidacy to be one of the sub-national pilots of the Open Government Partnership (OGP). Their proposal <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=b25f647af089f5f52485a663d&amp;id=07d4c73f51">was elected</a> and Civio is one of the civil society organizations to collaborate in the application of their pledges to Open Governance. We were invited to present and delve into this partnership at international conferences in Buenos Aires and at the annual summit of the OGP in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/opengovpart/status/807227623759900673">Paris</a>.</p>

            <p>Other processes we participated in to effect advances in transparency were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>We participated in the public consultation phase of the draft Law on Transparency and Good Governance <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.civio.es/2015/12/recomendaciones-de-civio-al-anteproyecto-de-ley-de-transparencia-y-buen-gobierno-de-castilla-la-mancha/">of Castilla-La Mancha</a>, at the request of the regional parliament.</p></li>
              <li><p>In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.europapress.es/andalucia/sevilla-00357/noticia-participa-pide-crear-registro-lobbies-publicar-reuniones-politicos-municipales-20160125153927.html">Seville</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.elcorreogallego.es/santiago/ecg/concello-presenta-un-proyecto-ordenanza-transparencia-aumentar-participacion-ciudadana/idEdicion-2016-04-19/idNoticia-992379/">Santiago de Compostela</a>, some of our proposals were gathered and taken to municipal plenaries by local groups.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>In October, during the celebration of the International Open Data Conference in Madrid, a group of civil society organizations sent a letter to the ministries of the Presidency, and of Industry, Energy and Tourism, to request a stronger commitment to roll out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.civio.es/2016/10/carta-abierta-al-gobierno-espanol-avanzar-en-datos-y-gobierno-abierto-iodc16/">open data and open government</a> across Spain. During this event we presented projects such as the <em>Pardonometer</em> and <em>OpenBudgets</em> to an international audience, and organised a party to encourage people to get to know us, establish and consolidate ties with other organizations, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/784445077787729921">to enjoy the Madrid sky</a>.</p>

            <p>Since September 2016, thanks to an alliance with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://filtrala.org/">FÃ­ltrala.org</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering transparency of public affairs via anonymous leaks, we now have at our disposal an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://filtrala.org/civio">online mailbox</a> through which anyone is able to reveal information of interest to the public to FundaciÃ³n Civio, in a fully encrypted way that guarantees <strong>anonymity</strong> and the <strong>safety of the sender</strong>.</p>
