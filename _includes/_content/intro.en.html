          <h3>Transparency. Accessible data. Journalism. Technology.</h3>
          <p>Civio works to achieve tangible, effective transparency, with free access to public data for any citizen or organization. We want to help establish a society built on an active, participatory citizenship, which benefits from evidence-based public debate and demands accountability of its institutions. To achieve this, we provide public service journalism on socially relevant topics, we develop tools to allow citizens easy access to public data, and we endeavor to drive cultural and legislative change within institutions.</p>

          <h3>2016, in brief</h3>
          <p><strong>International recognition and increased public engagement</strong></p>
          <p>2016 is our <strong>5th year of activity</strong>. For yet another year, we have achieved <strong>financial sustainability</strong> as an organization, striving to consolidate the model of diversified revenue streams implemented in previous financial years.</p>
          <p>In 2016, we have surprised the world with the quality, innovation and global reach of our investigative reports. One of these, <a href="http://medicamentalia.org/" title="Medicamentalia" target="_blank"><i>Medicamentalia</i></a>, was awarded <strong>two of the most important accolades in international journalism</strong>, a matter of particular pride and importance to a small organization such as ours which reports from the sidelines of the mainstream media. On a national level, our colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/mangelgavilanes" title="Miguel Ángel Gavilanes" target="_blank">Miguel Ángel Gavilanes</a>, a journalist on the Civio team, <a href="http://www.apmadrid.es/miguel-angel-gavilanes-el-periodismo-de-datos-es-sobre-todo-paciencia-buen-trabajo-y-potra/" target="_blank">received</a> the <strong>Best Young Journalist of the Year</strong>award from the Madrid Press Association (APM).</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we launched a new project, <a href="http://quiencobralaobra.es/" title="¿Quién cobra la obra?"  target="_blank"><i>¿Quién cobra la obra?</i></a>, (Who gets paid for the work? in English), an in-depth investigation into contracts for public works, which analyzes the role of the <strong>construction companies</strong> that have been awarded the biggest contracts, and their links to the <strong>public sector</strong>. We also continued to generate public interest pieces on the decisions that affect us all on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>In 2016 we have managed <strong>10 projects</strong>, 3 of international scope. Our team <strong>has grown</strong> with new employees and we have made special efforts to seek new and better partnerships for the future. We have provided technical support to many of <strong>the country's main municipalities and autonomous communities</strong> and thanks to these partnerships, around 15 million citizens can now easily consult data on what their taxes are used for. This double effort, coupled with our desire to produce <strong>more and better journalism</strong>, forms the base of our enthusiasm for the year ahead in 2017. We have played a decisive role in Spain's burgeoning transparency. Now is the time to implement changes with a lasting footprint, for the benefit of all.</p>
