              <p>More than <strong>816,000 unique users</strong> browsed our projects in 2016, to learn more about public administration and take a more active role in society, accounting <strong>for a 25% increase over 2015</strong>. More and more citizens, organizations, entities, social movements and public officials from all sectors are joining the public debate that we continue to promote, based on <strong>evidence and the free access to data</strong>.</p>

              <p>We have participated in and influenced regional, local and sectoral processes of adaptation to transparency. As a result of our recommendations, the regulatory recognition of public access to information is being <strong>expanded and strengthened through best practice</strong>, to the benefit of thousands of organizations and individuals. Our <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/04/recomendaciones-de-civio-para-una-mejora-efectiva-de-la-transparencia-ante-las-elecciones-municipales-y-autonomicas/">recommendations</a> for municipal transparency have been <strong>taken on board publicly by various groups</strong>, some with governmental responsibilities.</p>

              <p>By the end of 2016, <strong>14.7 million citizens</strong> (compared to 5.5 million in 2015) were able to verify which policies every single euro of their taxes is spent on, thanks to our efforts to make local authorities’ management of public budgets  more understandable, via <a href="http://www.civio.es/sector-publico/#donde-van-mis-impuestos"><em>Where do my taxes go?</em></a> Our first such collaboration, with the Government of Aragón, is one of the cases highlighted in the <a href="http://openbudgets.eu/assets/resources/Report-Laemmerhirt-Making-Budgets-Attractive.pdf">repost</a> <em>Making budgets attractive: best practices from governments’ financial transparency portals</em>. Through <em>OpenBudgets</em>, we have taken a logical step towards helping public bodies to not only make their budgets transparent but also <strong>participatory</strong>. The results of this project <a href="https://participaentuspresupuestos.torrelodones.es/">will be seen</a> in 2017.</p>

              <p>At the end of 2016, the government launched the 'express reform' (and urgent reform that doesn't need to be approved by Congress) of the Law on Public Procurement, a key move to put an end to corruption. And when they did so, thanks to everything we'd learnt from <em>¿Quién cobra la obra?</em>, <strong>we were prepared</strong>. Thanks to our recommendations and meetings with the main parliamentary groups, <strong>our proposals were practically adopted in full</strong> in the amendments of different parties, which will be voted on and incorporated into the law in 2017.</p>

              <p>Now more than ever there is discussion in our public institutions about how to publish the <strong>budgetary execution</strong> in the <strong>most detailed way possible</strong>, how to make the <strong>activities of pressure groups</strong> (lobbies) more transparent, as they start to come under regulation, how to publish the work and meetings schedules of senior officials, as well as <strong>the entire "legislative footprint"</strong> (the journey laws take and how they change at each step), of the absence of transparency in the <strong>public procurement of medicines and vaccines</strong>, and of the necessity to <strong>reform the Law on Pardons</strong>, amongst others. Our contribution to this discussion throughout 2016 was invaluable. When we launched <em>Quién manda</em> in 2013, there was little talk about the importance <strong>of being able to learn about the work and meetings schedules of</strong> senior officials. Some, even from within the field of transparency advocacy, questioned these demands. Today, <strong>it's in the spotlight</strong>. Our <a href="https://twitter.com/civio/status/857903835683188737">perseverance</a> in requesting this information from the Executive and the Legislature since 2013 is valued and was taken on by the Transparency Council in a recent <a href="http://consejodetransparencia.es/ct_Home/actualidad/noticias/hemeroteca/2017/04/20170428.html#.WQMJebErzBI">recommendation</a>. Several regional and local regulations, along with some of the main electoral programs at the last general elections, have also taken our proposals on board.</p>

              <p>The Board of Congress <a href="http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SalaPrensa/NotPre?_piref73_7706063_73_1337373_1337373.next_page=/wc/detalleNotaSalaPrensa&amp;idNotaSalaPrensa=19291&amp;anyo=2016&amp;mes=4&amp;pagina=1&amp;mostrarvolver=S&amp;movil=null">approved</a> the adoption of measures to <strong>publish visually and in detail the House's budgetary information</strong> with the aim of providing citizens with the useful knowledge of how allocated money is spent. Following our recommendations, such measures were requested by the spokespeople of the party Unidos Podemos-En Comú Podem-En Marea to the Committee on Budgets.</p>

              <p>The civic aims of our initiatives are fulfilled when we are able to release data to the public, and <strong>effect social change with these</strong>.The best example is, for another year running, <a href="http://www.elindultometro.es/index.html"><em>The Pardonometer</em></a>.After four years monitoring the granting of pardons, data revealed that the Government is now using this privilege with more caution. Social pressure is effective and, as detailed within this report, Civio's work has played an important part in this. <em>The Pardonometer</em> has been used in classes by the University of Barcelona, the Catholic University of Murcia and the European University of the Atlantic. On the other hand, our data on the price of hepatitis C <strong>drugs</strong> served as the basis for <a href="http://www.isglobal.org/-/el-precio-del-medicamento-de-la-hepatitis-c-en-espana-multiplica-por-277-su-coste-de-produccion">this IS Global report</a>: <em>Hepatitis C: The New Battleground for Access to Essential Medicines.</em> Likewise, data revealed by <em>Medicamentalia</em> allowed the Ukrainian agency Interfax to <a href="http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/339090.html">denounce</a> the difficulty Ukrainians face in purchasing essential medicines not so much due to their high prices as the low averages incomes in the country.</p>

              <p>In 2015 <a href="http://quienmanda.es/posts/el-senado-oculta-a-google-informacion-sobre-sus-senorias">we denounced</a> that the Senate was applying instructions to its website’s search engines (the <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Est%C3%A1ndar_de_exclusi%C3%B3n_de_robots">robots.txt</a> file) to block certain searchers' access to <a href="https://www.google.es/search?q=%22fichasenador%22+site:senado.es&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1181&amp;bih=702&amp;noj=1&amp;filter=0">senator's files</a>, and to <a href="https://www.google.es/search?q=%22detalleiniciativa%22+site:senado.es&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1181&amp;bih=702&amp;noj=1&amp;filter=0">various parliamentary initiatives</a>. This instruction was used, for example, to ensure that via search engines such as Google, it wasn't possible to find out which public representatives have links to private companies, as declared in their personal files. In 2016, following publication of this information, the Senate <strong>stopped blocking the indexing of this data</strong>.</p>

              <p>Our greatest victory, however, has been to close 2016 yet again with a <strong>positive balance</strong>, a <strong>team which is growing stronger</strong>, the motivation to <strong>face new, larger challenges</strong> in 2017, and the confidence to commit to our donors and followers, ensuring we live up to their expectations.</p>
