              <p>Despite transparency being introduced into Spanish institutions back in 2014, it is still in <strong>the early, yet very important, stages</strong>. As yet we have no approved regulation for the implementation of the state-wide law, the more ambiguous limits of the rules allow for systematic concealment of information from citizens, the obstacles hampering the right of access that we have denounced since 2013 are still in place, and public bodies still choose - all too often - to litigate against the Transparency Council in order to not hand over data. Within this context, and with the regulation of lobbies and reforms to the laws on public procurement just around the corner, an organization such as Civio, with its wealth of experience and commitment in the long-term to genuine, efficient transparency within public institutions, is today, <strong>more important than ever before</strong>.</p>

              <p>Delving deeper, for the first time in 2016, into the realm of <strong>public procurement</strong> has only confirmed what we feared. Information about what the public purse is spent on in Spain is far more scattered, far more erroneous, and far more inconsistent than we thought. It is a lot more difficult to get our hands on this data, as we've learned from <em>¿Quién cobra la obra?</em>, and this only serves to confirm that our work is <strong>essential</strong>. That's why promoting transparency in public procurement is one of our main focuses for 2017.</p>

              <p>Although Civio has been a financially sustainable organization for another year running <strong>long-term consolidation</strong> remains a challenge of the highest caliber. Securing new revenue is crucial to Civio's sustainability and growth, but we still have <strong>considerable dependencies</strong>. On the one hand, we have our grants and institutional support. In 2016 we presented a proposal to the European Commission, our most ambitious proposal yet, to create a network of international media that would report, in a coordinated way and with a Europe-wide as well as local focus, on health provision and justice. The effort and the resources spent on creating the proposal were ultimately not rewarded, but we continue to trust in the high potential of the project and are keeping it on the back burner. On the other hand, we have our provision of services to the public sector as a source of self-financing. These <a href="http://www.civio.es/sector-publico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">services</a> based on <strong>specialized knowledge</strong> and with <strong>high added value</strong> have proved key to our sustainability throughout 2016, and will continue to do so in 2017. The support of <strong>large international donors</strong> has also played its role in allowing us to carry out projects with a transnational scope, which require higher levels of funding. We have been proactive in approaching large donors and will continue in the same vein. We continue to increase the demands on ourselves to ensure that such dependencies do not detract from the efficiency and rigor of our work.</p>

              <p>To improve, we must <strong>continue to look outwith Spain</strong>. As reported in our 2015 Annual Report, Spain’s framework of organizations - with stable teams, resources and rigorous methodology - specialising in the field of civic technology, is still in <strong>a nascent phase</strong> compared to other countries. The benchmarks, the successful experiments, the strategic vision on what transparency implies in the long run, all lie outside of the country. The close collaboration we embarked upon in 2015 with organizations based in other countries (for the project <em>OpenBudgets</em>, for example) was consolidated in 2016, and will bear new fruits throughout 2017.</p>

              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
              <p>Our 2016 Annual Plan turned out to be over optimistic. The workload on the larger projects (<em>Onodo</em>, <em>¿Quién cobra la obra?</em>, <em>OpenBudgets</em>) left us <strong>a very tight margin</strong> when added to our essential day to day activities: to increase public advocacy, more journalistic work, to deliver training or respond to hundreds of queries we receive annually from journalists, authorities and citizens. In 2015 we stated that planning work would require experience, time and perspective to attain the highest standards of quality, and we recognized "difficulties in long-term planning in areas such as <strong>hiring new staff</strong> time spent on <strong>current or new projects</strong> and the search for <strong>sources of funding</strong>”. To grow as a foundation in the long term, we need to improve our planning and do so in accordance with <strong>clearly defined goals.</strong></p>

              <p>We generate a huge amount of content throughout the year. Until now, this has been published on various websites associated with each of the projects we run - on <em>El BOE nuestro de cada día</em>, on <em>Quién manda</em>, on <em>El indultómetro</em>, etc-. This made sense while we only had a few projects. Now, with an expanded portfolio, we are exploring how we can merge this enormous and varied amount of information in one single website, facilitating access and <strong>better reflecting the journalistic essence of Civio</strong>.</p>

              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
              <p>We once again assert that <strong>the future of Civio depends on its collaborators</strong>, on engaging a community of individuals who identify with our organization’s goals and projects, and who are willing to regularly contribute with the economic assistance we require. Their support is vital in order to better plan our work, and avoid exclusive dependency on other sources of funding - the provision of services, winning international awards or securing grants. "Each donor is different, each one has their own priorities and motivations," we stated in the 2014 Annual Report. In 2017 we are endeavouring to understand their expectations and live up to them. We will strive to show that in all of our decisions, <strong>with rigor and credibility</strong>, their support is worthwhile.</p>
