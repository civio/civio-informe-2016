            <p>Throughout 2016 we continued to share our experience via courses, workshops and forums with public authorities, communication groups and social organizations. Below are some examples.</p>
            <p>On the journalism side, we established <strong>partnerships with the media and non-profit organizations</strong> to extend the scope of our investigations and kick start some new ones, e.g. with the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://investigativecenters.org/">ANCIR</a>) and with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hivos.org/">Hivos</a>.</p>
            <p>In terms of training, we participated in the <strong>Entrepreneurial Journalism seminars at UCAM</strong>, Murcia, with a workshop on how we carry out our journalistic practices from the sidelines of the mainstream media. We also delivered a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/mipumh/statuses/705033690263453696">module on data and new narratives</a> at the <strong>Miguel Hernández University</strong> of Elche, training on data processing and visualization in the newsroom of Cuatro TV, and we continued to form part of the teaching staff on the <strong>Master of Research Journalism, Data And Visualization</strong> of Editorial Unity, as well as Rey Juan Carlos University.</p>

            <p>Along with 23 journalists from 7 countries, we participated in a seminar on political <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.fnpi.org/es/fnpi/as%C3%AD-fue-la-primera-jornada-del-seminario-sobre-captura-pol%C3%ADtica-desigualdad-y-periodismo">capture, inequality and journalism</a> organized by the Fundación Nuevo Periodismo Iberoamericano and Oxfam in Mexico City.</p>
            <p>Thanks to our partnerships with the public sector, we were invited by the <strong>Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces</strong> (FEMP) to speak at the 9th Conference on Modernization of Citizen Participation and Quality (Malaga). We also shared our experience by opening up public data and bringing it closer to citizens in seminars held in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/civio/statuses/790478276326195200">Oviedo</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/qepea/statuses/733581123071025152">San Sebastián</a> and Terrassa. We participated in activities organized by the <strong>Federation of Catalan Municipalities</strong>, the <strong>ESADE</strong> business school, <strong>Chaminade High School</strong> and the <strong>Spanish Association of Foundations</strong>. We also formed part of the jury of the <strong>Go App! Madrid 2016</strong>, organised by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/apps4citizens/statuses/745668332498657280">Apps for Citizens</a>, and presented our book ‘Españopoly’ in Zaragoza.</p>
            <p>Throughout 2016, we responded to <strong>100s of enquiries from citizens, journalists and authorities</strong>, the majority related to access and better understanding of public information. This is an onerous, on-going task of training and query resolution, which addresses the public service function that our organization has pledged.</p>
