            <p>Although we shut down the platform <em>Tu derecho a saber</em> (<em>Your right to know</em>, in English) in December 2015, in 2016 we were very active in terms of pushing for broader rights of access to public information. The <a href="http://blog.tuderechoasaber.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tu derecho a saber blog</a> is still a go-to source on the practical execution of the Right of Access. Over the last year we have written 5 new articles and the blog has  registered almost 30,000 unique users.</p>

            <p><strong>3 activities</strong> to highlight from 2016 in relation to this right:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>The <a href="http://www.civio.es/2016/10/asi-fue-el-maraton-de-preguntas-del-dia-internacional-del-derecho-a-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marathon of requests for information</a> that we organized together with the <strong>Transparency Council</strong> and <strong>Access Info Europe</strong> to commemorate International Right to Know Day. On this day, we launched a simple form that anyone could use to request information without technical restriction e.g., not possessing an electronic certificate, and channeled these requests ourselves. <strong>90 citizens sent us over 160 requests for information</strong> addressed to several ministries, councils, municipalities and other public organizations. The event was a resounding success, and served to highlight just <a href="http://www.civio.es/2016/10/asi-fue-el-maraton-de-preguntas-del-dia-internacional-del-derecho-a-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how much still needs to be done</a> to facilitate the requesting of information from public institutions.</p></li>

              <li><p>The <strong>Workshop on Access to Information for <a href="http://www.civio.es/2016/10/asi-fue-nuestro-taller-de-acceso-a-la-informacion-para-organizaciones-sociales-y-vecinales-transparencia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social and neighbourhood organizations</a></strong>.

This session was delivered by the Civio team along with Access Info Europe, the Transparency Council and the Transparency Directorate of the City of Madrid.</p></li>
              <li><p>We participated in a campaign organised by Access Info Europe in which <a href="http://www.civio.es/2016/12/mas-de-40-academicos-espanoles-reclaman-el-reconocimiento-del-derecho-de-acceso-a-la-informacion-como-un-derecho-fundamental/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 40 Spanish academics</a> demanded that the Right to Access Information be recognized as a basic right.</p></li>

            <p>Throughout 2016 we have submitted dozens of requests for information. Two ministries in particular have hampered Civio's access to data of public interest: <strong>Development</strong> and <strong>Defense</strong>. The former declared our request inadmissible, <a href="http://blog.tuderechoasaber.es/2016/04/fomento-rehusa-dar-datos-sobre-sus-pagos-para-carreteras-y-cuestiona-la-seriedad-del-solicitante/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an information request on</a> the relationship of payments made by the ministry in two very specific rounds of payment earmarked for the <a href="http://dondevanmisimpuestos.es/programas/453B/creacion-de-infraestructura-de-carreteras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creation</a>, <a href="http://dondevanmisimpuestos.es/programas/453C/conservacion-y-explotaci%C3%B3n-de-carreteras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintenance and exploitation of roadways</a>, going so far as to question “the serious and legitimate purpose of the applicant”. Defense went even further. This ministry has taken a Transparency Council resolution to court. The resolution dealt with a request by Civio to reveal who the passengers on official flights are, with the exception of travel undertaken by the President or members of the Royal Family, given that these are classified. After losing the <a href="http://blog.tuderechoasaber.es/2017/02/el-juez-obliga-a-defensa-a-identificar-a-los-pasajeros-de-los-aviones-oficiales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first case</a>, Defense <a href="http://www.civio.es/2017/03/defensa-deslegitima-al-consejo-de-transparencia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appealed</a> the judgment, which was in our favour, meaning we will continue to fight for this information to be revealed throughout 2017.</p>
