             <p>There are many people who are willing to help and selflessly give part of their time to helping us promote transparency:</p>
            <p><strong>Hugo Garrido</strong> was, for yet another year, crucial to the update of <em>Spain in flames.</em>.</p>
            <p><em>Medicamentalia</em> is a joint achievement which received a lot of help from the journalist <strong>Asier Andrés</strong> in Guatemala and <strong>Julio Hernández</strong> with video sound, in El Salvador; besides, <em>Medicamentalia</em> would have reached far fewer people without the invaluable support of <strong>Verónica Ramírez</strong>, on La Sexta, by <strong>Marta Ley</strong>, <strong>Pablo Medina</strong> and <strong>Hugo Garrido</strong> at El Mundo Data, by <strong>Hristio Boytchev</strong>, of Corret!v and <strong>Sabine Louet</strong> at EuroScientist, who supported us as far as possible.</p>
            <p>With a project as complex as <em>¿Quién cobra la obra?</em> it would have been much more difficult to dig up the dirt without <strong>Asier Andrés</strong>, who delved into Spanish procurement regulations, <strong>Antonio Almansa</strong> and his leads on public procurement, <strong>Imma Borrás</strong>, who helped us to interpret the law, <strong>Manuel Acevedo</strong> and <strong>Guillermo Llopis</strong>, with information gathering and <strong>Carmela Castro</strong>, for comparing our law with that of other countries.</p>
            <p><strong>Irene Cruz</strong> and <strong>Francesco Cortellese</strong> have helped us with the <em>Pardonometer</em>; and <strong>Crystal Serrano</strong>, from Florida, helped us with the organization's day to day tasks throughout the summer of 2016.</p>
